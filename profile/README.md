## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Prototype club! You have made it to the right place.

# What is Prototype Club?
## Like a book club, but for game makers. <br>
Here, we share prototypes with each other, work on the ones that seem fun, and stop whenever we want. Prototype club is very casual - no project leads, no deadlines, and no pressure. It's Just a group of people who want to make games and have fun doing it.  


# Why Prototype Club?
Prototypes generate ideas, ideas generate prototypes, prototypes generate games. <br>
<br>
Our goal is to push the discussion of game design forward. We aim to generate new ideas, and collaborate on experimental (and not so experimental) games.

## Discuss on Discord
Join the discord to discuss ideas, game design, and get involved. <br>

# How can I contribute?
## Contribution guide/guidelines 
1. Share Your Prototypes
  There are two ways of sharing prototypes, you can either: 
  a. This is the recommended way. Clone your project and set the Prototype-Club organization as the owner. This way, you can keep your project private and only share it with the community.
  b. Share a link to your project on discord. If you don't know how to use GIT or GitHub this is an easy way to get started. But we strongly recommend using GitHub.

2. Provide Feedback
    You can use the issues tab to provide feedback on a project. You can also use the comments section on the project page.

3. Collaborate
  Join forces with other members on interesting prototypes. Share your skills, be it coding, art, sound design, or writing. Collaboration is key to creating something special.
4. Participate in Discussions

Engage in game design discussions on Discord. Share your thoughts, ask questions, and explore new concepts. This helps everyone grow as game designers.

5. Respect and Support

Be respectful and supportive of all members. Constructive criticism is welcome, but always be kind and considerate. Remember, weâ€™re all here to learn and have fun.

6. Stay Active

Stay active in the community by regularly checking in, sharing updates on your progress, and participating in group activities. Your involvement helps keep the club vibrant and dynamic.

- We use git to manage our projects. If you are new to git, you can learn more about it here.
- If if you want to make a change that is out of scope or feature creep, make a branch and work on it there.
