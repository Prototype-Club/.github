## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Prototype club! You have made it to the right place. <br>
[Skip to how to participate club activities](#How-can-I-contribute) <br>


# What is Prototype Club?
### Like a book club, but for game makers. <br>
Here, we share prototypes with each other, work on the ones that seem fun, and stop whenever we want. Prototype club is very casual - no project leads, no deadlines, and no pressure. It's Just a group of people who want to make games and have fun doing it.  

## Why Prototype Club?
### Prototypes generate ideas, ideas generate prototypes, prototypes generate games. <br>
Our goal is to push the discussion of game design forward. We aim to generate new ideas, and collaborate on experimental (and not so experimental) games.

## Discuss on Discord
Join the discord to discuss ideas, game design, and get involved. <br>

# How can I contribute?
## Contribution guide/guidelines 
1. **Share Your Prototypes** <br>
  To share just **fork your project and set the Prototype-Club organization as the owner.**<br>
    - Add some screenshots or a video to your readme to give others a sense of what your prototype is about. 
    - Private Repos are only visible to other members of Prototype Club. <br>
    - You might also want to provide a build of the game if you want feedback. 
    - Check out [How we use git](#how-we-use-git) for more information on git.
    <br><br>
    - Alternative: Share a link to your project on discord. If you don't know how to use GIT or GitHub this is an easy way to get started. But we strongly recommend using GitHub.
   
1. **Work on any prototype you find interesting**
  If you find a prototype you like, start working on it and contribute your changes, no need to ask for permission. <br>
  Join forces with other members on interesting prototypes. Share your skills, be it coding, art, sound design, or writing. Collaboration is key.
    - Note: If you want to make a change that is radically different, out of scope or feature creep, just make a branch and work on it there instead.

1. **Provide Feedback** <br>
    - Use Github features like issues tab or discussions tab provide feedback on a project.
    - Discuss on [ðŸŽ® Discord](https://discord.gg/M5Nxhnwv). Engage in game design discussions. Share your thoughts, ask questions, and explore new concepts. This helps everyone grow as game designers.
    - Club git activity will automatically show up on the github channel on discord. <br>

1. **Turn something into a full game.** <br>
  If you find a prototype you like, you can fork it and turn it into a full game. You can also ask the original creator if they would like to collaborate on a full game. Don't be afarid to allow others to use your prototype as a base for their own game, that is the point of Prototype Club, to inspire eachother.

1. **Respect and Support**<br>
Be respectful and supportive of all members. Constructive criticism is welcome, but always be kind and considerate. Remember, weâ€™re all here to learn and have fun. <br>
Stay active in the community by regularly checking in, sharing updates on your progress, and participating in group activities. Your involvement helps keep the club vibrant and dynamic.
