## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Prototype club! You have made it to the right place.

# What is Prototype Club?
### Like a book club, but for game makers. <br>
Here, we share prototypes with each other, work on the ones that seem fun, and stop whenever we want. Prototype club is very casual - no project leads, no deadlines, and no pressure. It's Just a group of people who want to make games and have fun doing it.  

## Why Prototype Club?
### Prototypes generate ideas, ideas generate prototypes, prototypes generate games. <br>
Our goal is to push the discussion of game design forward. We aim to generate new ideas, and collaborate on experimental (and not so experimental) games.

## Discuss on Discord
Join the discord to discuss ideas, game design, and get involved. <br>

# How can I contribute?
## Contribution guide/guidelines 


1. **Share Your Prototypes** <br>
  There are two ways of sharing prototypes, you can either: 
   * **Recommended way:** Clone your project and set the Prototype-Club organization as the owner. This way, you can keep your project private and only share it with the community.
   <br><br>
    Check out [How we use git](#how-we-use-git) for more information.
    <br><br>
   * Alternative: Share a link to your project on discord. If you don't know how to use GIT or GitHub this is an easy way to get started. But we strongly recommend using GitHub.
   
    You might also want to provide a build of the game if you want feedback. 

1. **Provide Feedback** <br>
    Engage in game design discussions on Discord. Share your thoughts, ask questions, and explore new concepts. This helps everyone grow as game designers.
    * Discuss on [ðŸŽ® Discord](https://discord.gg/M5Nxhnwv)
    * You can use the issues tab to provide feedback on a project. You can also use the comments section on the project page.

1. **Collaborate** <br>
  Join forces with other members on interesting prototypes. Share your skills, be it coding, art, sound design, or writing. Collaboration is key to creating something special.

1. **Respect and Support**<br>
Be respectful and supportive of all members. Constructive criticism is welcome, but always be kind and considerate. Remember, weâ€™re all here to learn and have fun.

# GIT
## How we use git
Private projects on Prototype-Club are only accessable to other memembers. This is the main way we share projects. <br> (You can make it public if you want to share your project with everyone on the internet.)

*Use the following guide to contriubte using git and github.*

### Sharing project guide

* Create a fork of your project, making Prototype-Club the owner. <br> 
Private Repos are only visible to other members

* If you project is not on github already, you can make a Repo making Prototype-Club the owner.

* If you want to make a change that is out of scope or feature creep, **make a branch and work on it there**.

* Any changes to repos in Prototype-Club will be displayed on our [ðŸŽ® Discord](https://discord.gg/M5Nxhnwv). Use it to keep up to date with what others are doing.
